Toasted War Helper is a quick way to find out who you can and can't attack, their status and when they're leaving hospital directly on your Ranked War page. It requires a Limited Access (Yellow) API key and a TornStats account in order to make use of Faction Spies / Personal Spies. The hospital timer will also change color once hitting <2 minutes until they are discharged and immmediately will the Attack button be displayed.
